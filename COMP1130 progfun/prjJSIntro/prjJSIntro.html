<!--**************  Document your problem-solving skills ****************
I had only two problems,

(1) Getting the javascript file linked up with the HTML file
I had originally thought that it would require a simlar system as CSS needs, and i was right, but I didn't know how so I googled how to 
(expect to hear that a lot throughout the corse)

(2) Getting "getUserID()" to give its variable to "displayUserID()"
I now know how to declare global variable. I didn't when I first wrote it and thanks to the console on chrome I figured out why really quick. 
Then I (you guessed it) googled how to make a global variable.

<!--****************************** Debuging *****************************
If page doesn't display correctly make sure "prjJSIntro.css" is in the same directory as prjJSintro.html
If scripts fail to load make sure "prjJSIntro.js" is in the same directory as prjJSintro.html
If pictuer is not present at tope of screen make sure "dus.png" is in the same directory as prjJSintro.html

NOTE - To pass validation it was required to move the comment block below the meta tag.

            <p>The most important thing that I learned from the Learning Activities (Create a Web Page) is to create a template. <br />
            I did not think at first that I would need a template because I  assumed everything would end up being different. <br />
            I know see how this is not only a flawed idea but also bad practice. I had a general grasp on everything else from past experiences.</p><br />
